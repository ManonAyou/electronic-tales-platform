Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable |richlink_1| computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, |richlink_2| the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster |richlink_3|.</p><br><br><p>More features are :</p><ul><li>Computing</li><li>Monitoring</li><li>Processing ðŸš€</li></ul>',
